# The PS4 system game structure  
1 The product code is distinct to a region, and the common codes youâ€™ll see are CUSA, PCAS, and PLAS.      
It is followed by a unique number ID.        
R1 USA-*CUSA*       
R2 Europe-*CUSA*         
R3 Asia-*PLAS*, *PCAS*

Another example Resident Evil 2, USA is *CUSA09193* while Asia is *PLAS10335*

# This explains what each option in the tool does to my knowledge    
1. Remarry Game + Update         
If you have a mismatched Update file use this option along with the base game you have to remarry the Update file data and generate one compatible with the base game.   
        
2. Merge Game + Update      
If you'd like to install a game as 1 file or save hdd space use this option.      
        
3. Backup Backported Files    
Choose a file that has previously had work done to make it compatible with lower firmware and backup the *backport* data. It will be turned into a .zip archive file.      
       
4. PS4 Rebuild PKG - Backport       
This will let you build the data from *3. Backup Backported Files* along with the base game and update and create a Backport UPDATE pkg (the base game will still need to be installed or merged via option 2. Merge Game + Update)  
        
5. Merge Game + Update + Backport    
Use this option to manually create your own lower firmware AIO backported game using the base game a update and the backport data created from  *3. Backup Backported Files* which  allows it to work on lower firmware.    
This is basically option 2 and 3 in one process
